# 🌾 AgriPrice – Farm Produce Price Tracker API

AgriPrice is a RESTful API built with Django REST Framework (DRF) that enables farmers, administrators, and consumers to track and manage farm produce prices across different markets.

The system promotes transparency in agricultural markets and enforces secure role-based access control using JWT authentication.

---

## 🚀 Features Implemented

### 🔐 Authentication System (JWT-Based)

- User Registration
- Login (Access & Refresh Tokens)
- Token Refresh
- Logout (Refresh Token Blacklisting)
- Password Reset (Email-based)
- Role-Based Authorization (ADMIN, FARMER, CONSUMER)

Authentication is implemented using:

- Django REST Framework
- SimpleJWT

---

### 👤 Custom User Model

The system uses a custom user model extending `AbstractUser`.

**User Fields:**

- id
- username
- email (unique)
- password (hashed securely)
- role (ADMIN, FARMER, CONSUMER)
- is_verified
- date_joined

Authentication is email-based.

---

### 🏪 Market Management

Markets are managed strictly by ADMIN users.

**Market Fields:**

- id
- name
- location
- created_by (ForeignKey to User)
- created_at
- updated_at

**Permissions:**

| Role      | View | Create | Update | Delete |
|-----------|------|--------|--------|--------|
| ADMIN     | ✅   | ✅     | ✅     | ✅     |
| FARMER    | ✅   | ❌     | ❌     | ❌     |
| CONSUMER  | ✅   | ❌     | ❌     | ❌     |

### 🌽 Produce Management

Farmers and Admins can manage produce prices.

**Produce Fields:**

- id
- name
- market (ForeignKey to Market)
- price
- farmer (ForeignKey to User)
- description
- quantity_available
- date_added
- updated_at

**Permissions:**

| Role      | View | Add | Update | Delete |

| CONSUMER  | ✅   | ❌  | ❌     | ❌     |

Object-level permissions ensure farmers can only modify their own produce records.

---

### 🔎 Filtering, Search & Ordering

Produce endpoints support:

- Filter by market
- Filter by farmer
- Search by produce name
- Order by price
- Order by date_added

Implemented using:

- DjangoFilterBackend

This section documents the advanced backend improvements implemented during this development cycle.

---

## 1️⃣ Price History Tracking

### 🎯 Objective
Introduce full auditability of produce price changes.

### 🛠 Implementation
- Added `PriceHistory` model
- Automatically records:
  - Previous price
  - Updated price
  - Timestamp of change
- Triggered during produce update operations

### 📈 Impact
- Enables historical price analysis
- Supports future reporting features
- Improves data transparency
- Establishes audit trail for price modifications

---

## 2️⃣ Automated Price Alert Triggering

### 🎯 Objective
Implement real-time notification logic when produce prices change.

### 🛠 Implementation
- Created dedicated `alerts` app
- Implemented `PriceAlert` model
- Integrated Django signals to detect price updates
- Automatically evaluates:
  - Threshold-based alerts
  - General price increase/decrease subscriptions
- Sends email notifications to buyers

### 🧠 Architectural Improvement
Introduced event-driven behavior using model signals, enabling reactive business logic without coupling it to views.

---

## 3️⃣ Market Access Restriction for Farmers

### 🎯 Objective
Enforce business rules restricting where farmers can post produce.

### 🛠 Implementation
- Added `allowed_markets` (ManyToMany → Market) relationship to `User`
- Enforced validation inside `Produce` serializer
- Prevents unauthorized market submissions at API level

### 📈 Impact
- Strengthens data integrity
- Enforces domain constraints
- Moves business rules into the application layer (not frontend)

---

## 4️⃣ Analytics Endpoint

### 🎯 Objective
Provide aggregated insights into produce pricing data.

### 🔗 Endpoint



## 🛠 Tech Stack

- Python 3.12
- Django 6
- Django REST Framework
- SimpleJWT
- SQLite (Development)
- Console Email Backend (Development)

## 🧪 Development Email Configuration

During development, emails are printed to the console:

```python
EMAIL_BACKEND = 'django.core.mail.backends.console.EmailBackend'
```

This allows testing password reset functionality without SMTP configuration.

##  🧪 Production Email Configuration
```python
EMAIL_BACKEND = 'django.core.mail.backends.smtp.EmailBackend'
```

This allows:

✅ Clients to receive real-time email alerts

✅ Farmers to receive product-related notifications

✅ Threshold price change alerts
